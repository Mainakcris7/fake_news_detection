# Fake News Detection

This project is dedicated to detecting fake news articles using `Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM`), a type of `recurrent neural network (RNN)`. The primary objective is to develop a deep learning model that can effectively differentiate between legitimate and fabricated news sources based on textual content.

## Key Features
1. **LSTM-Based Sequence Modeling:** The project utilizes `Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)`, a powerful type of recurrent neural network, for sequence modeling of textual data. This enables the model to capture long-range dependencies and context in news articles, making it highly effective in detecting fake news..

2. **Performance Evaluation:** The project places a strong emphasis on model evaluation, employing various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix analysis. This comprehensive evaluation ensures that the LSTM model is reliable and effective in distinguishing between real and fake news sources.
